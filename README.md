# VasicekAndHo-LeeModel

This page is under construction. The file 'OuSim.py' (the loop method, not optimized at this moment but will be in the future) simulates a sample path of the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process. In the future, codes for three different methods to calibrate the Vasicek model will be uploaded.
